\section{Motivation}
We now move onto \textbf{unsupervised learning}, where the objective is to learn the structure of unlabeled data. In other words, we are looking for groups, or \textbf{clusters} among the data. Clustering algorithms are useful not only for finding groups in data, but also to extract features of the data that summarize the most important information about the data in a compressed way. \\
For most clustering algorithms, we need some kind of a metric that we can use to specify the notion of "distance" between the data points. If, for example, the points $\textbf{x}$ and $\textbf{x'}$ live in some Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^m$, then the natural choice of such metric is the $l_2$ distance:
\begin{align*}
	 ||\textbf{x} - \textbf{x'}|| &= \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - x_i')^2}
\end{align*}

Now that the metric is well-defined, the next thing we need to do is to decide how many groups we want. Sometimes you know the ideal number of groups in advance (\textit{e.g.} clustering alphabet). Other times, you need to decide if you'd like a more compressed representation with more information loss by having the number of groups small, or a less compressed representation with less information loss by having the number of groups large. \\
Suppose our data set is $\{\textbf{x}_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$, then our objective is to find the ideal assignment of the data set to the clusters, by assigning to each of the $n$ data points, a binary \textbf{responsibility vector} $\textbf{r}_i$, which is all zeros except one component, which corresponds to the assigned cluster.

\section{K-Means Algorithm}
The idea is to represent each cluster by the point in data space that is the average of the data assigned to it. For some choice of $K$, 
the K-Means Algorithm (also called Lloyd's algorithm)
keeps doing the following: iterate through the data points and update the responsibility vectors according to their closest means,
and iterate over the mean vectors $\{\bmu_k\}_{k=1}^{K}$ 
and change them to be the mean of the examples currently assigned the cluster. 
%After that, we
%
We repeat this until convergence: until none of the responsibility vectors change.
% \\
%(\textit{The pseudocode for Lloyd's Algorithm should be reviewed in section.})

\subsection{Derivation}
We begin by defining a loss function:
\begin{align*}
	 \mcL(\{\textbf{r}_i\}_{i=1}^n,\{\bmu_k\}_{k=1}^K) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{k=1}^{K} r_{ik} ||\textbf{x}_i - \bmu_k ||^2
\end{align*}
and the K-Means Algorithm minimizes this via coordinate descent.
We first choose $r_{i}$ such that:
\begin{align*}
	 r_{ik} &= \begin{cases}
	 	1 & \mbox{if }k = argmin_{k'}||\textbf{x}_i - \bmu_{k'}|| \\
	 	0 & \mbox{otherwise}
	 \end{cases}
\end{align*}

Having fixed everything else, we see that it is equivalent, for a given
$k$, to minimize the square loss:
%
\begin{align*}
	 \mcL(\bmu_k) &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{ik} ||\textbf{x}_i -\bmu_k||^2 \\
	 &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{ik} (\textbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)^T(\textbf{x}_i - \bmu_k)
\end{align*}
Taking the derivative and setting it to zero,
\begin{align*}
	 \frac{\partial \mcL(\bmu_k)}{\partial \bmu_k} &= -2 \sum_{i = 1}^{n} r_{ik} (\textbf{x}_i - \bmu_k) = 0 \\
	 \bmu_k &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n r_{ik}\textbf{x}_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}r_{ik}}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Number of Clusters}

\if 0
Our main approach is to use the idea of the \textbf{gap statistic}. We can define the within-cluster dispersion:
\begin{align*}
	 D_k &= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{i'=1}^{n} r_{ik} r_{i'k} ||\textbf{x}_i - \textbf{x'}_i||^2
\end{align*}
Then the dispersion for the clustering is the normalized sum of the within-cluster dispersion over all the clusters:
\begin{align*}
	 W_k &= \sum_{k=1}^{K} \frac{1}{2\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_{ik}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{i'=1}^{n} r_{ik} r_{i'k} ||\textbf{x}_i - \textbf{x'}_i||^2
\end{align*}
To compute the gap statistic, we use a null distribution for the data, from which we generate reference data. Then, the gap statistic can be computed:
\begin{align*}
	 Gap_i(K) &= \mathbb{E}_{iull}[\log{W_K}] - \log{W_K} 
\end{align*}
\fi

There is not an especially well justified method to choose the number
of clusters when using K-means. One approach is to plot $K$ vs the
objective criterion, and look for a ``knee'' or ``kink'' where
progress slows down.

An advanced method is to use the ``gap statistic''. But this is out of
scope for the course.

\subsection{Notes}

Lloyd's algorithm finds a local optimal solution.  Finding the global
optimal is NP-hard. A common strategy is to use random restarts. More
recently, an algorithm called \textbf{K-Means++} has enjoyed popular
usage as an alternative to random initialization. This is out of scope
for the course, but the basic idea is to randomly select some of the
data to be the first cluster centers.  This is done by iteratively
adding cluster centers, sampling them in proportion to the squared
distance of each example from its nearest cluster center.  Thus
K-Means++ tends to favor points that are distant from the existing
centers and produce a more diverse set of centers.

It is generally a good idea to \textbf{standardize} the data to account for unsatisfying result due to dimension mismatch.
Lastly, when for the metric we are using for the given data set, a "mean" does not make sense, we might instead use a \textbf{K-Medoids Algorithm}. This algorithm requires the cluster centers to be a data point in the data set. 

\section{Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering}

Hierarchical clustering constructs a tree over the data, where the leaves are individual data items, while the root is a single cluster that contains all of the data. When drawing the dendrogram, for the clustering to be valid, the distances between the two groups being merged should be monotonically increasing. 
%(\textit{The pseudocode for HAC should be reviewed in section.}) \\
The main decision in using
HAC is what the distance criterion should be between groups.

\subsection{The Min-Linkage Criterion}
For two groups indexed by $i$ and $i'$, the idea is to merge groups based on the shortest distance over all possible pairs:
\begin{align*}
	 \mathit{DIST}_{\mathrm{min}}(\{\boldx_i\}_{i=1}^{n}, \{\boldx_{i'}\}_{i'=1}^{n'}) &= \min_{i,i'}||\boldx_i - \boldx_{i'}||.
\end{align*}
%this produces the minimum spanning tree for the data.

\subsection{The Max-Linkage Criterion}
For two groups indexed by $i$ and $i'$, the idea is to merge groups based on the largest distance over all possible pairs:
\begin{align*}
	 \mathit{DIST}_{\mathrm{max}}(\{\boldx_i\}_{i=1}^{n}, \{\boldx_{i'}\}_{i'=1}^{n'})
 &= \max_{i,i'}||\boldx_i - \boldx_{i'}||
\end{align*}

\subsection{The Average-Linkage Criterion}
For two groups indexed by $i$ and $i'$, the idea is to average over all possible pairs between the groups:
\begin{align*}
	 \mathit{DIST}_{\mathrm{avg}}(\{\boldx_i\}_{i=1}^{n}, \{\boldx_{i'}\}_{i'=1}^{n'})
&= \frac{1}{nn'} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{i'=1}^{n'} ||\boldx_i - \boldx_{i'}||
\end{align*}

\subsection{The Centroid-Linkage Criterion}
For two groups indexed by $i$ and $i'$, the idea is to look at the difference between the groups' centroids:
\begin{align*}
	 \mathit{DIST}_{\mathrm{cent}}(\{\boldx_i\}_{i=1}^{n}, \{\boldx_{i'}\}_{i'=1}^{n'})
&= ||\left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \boldx_i \right) - \left( \frac{1}{n'} \sum_{i'=1}^{n'} \boldx_{i'} \right)||
\end{align*}

%\subsection{Divisive Clustering}
%While HAC is a bottom-up procedure, divising clustering is a top-down procedure, starting with a single group with all the data in it and then dividing and subdividing it into smaller groups using other clustering algorithms like K-Means or K-Medoids.

Since there are a finite number of possible assignments, each with a corresponding unique minimum with regard to the~$\{\bmu_k\}^K_{k=1}$, the K-Means algorithm will converge after a finite number of steps, when no changes to the responsibilities will decrease the objective.

%In terms of efficiency and determinism, when would HAC be a better method than divisive clustering?
}} \\
\begin{solution}
Let's look at what each algorithm does. For K-means, we have two steps, the assignment step and the centroid update. For the assignment step, we have $O(nKm)$, where $n$ is the size of data and $m$ is your dimensions because you have to compare each example with each of the centroids. Then, we have $O(nm)$ for the centroid update, since we will be calculating different averages for each of the centroids. Overall, with $T$ iterations we are left with $O(nKmT)$. 

For HAC, we start with each point in its own cluster, and combine the
two closest clusters until we are left with one big cluster. We get a
runtime of $O(n^2m)$ because we need to calculate the pairwise
distances for all $n$ examples.  In each of the $T_h$ clustering steps,
we then have $O(n^2)$ steps to use these pairwise distances and
whatever linkage we're using to compute the distances between existing
clusters.  Generally, $T_h$ is smaller than $m$ and the overall
complexity is $O(n^2m)$.

Comparing K-means and HAC, for large data sets we'd expect $KT$ in
K-means to be smaller than $n$, and thus K-means to be faster than
HAC.

The curse of dimensionality refers to the problem

The problem is that the distance
between two examples with
some informative features but lots
and lots of random features 
will be approximately the same (try this out in simulation
if you don't see why!). 

This means that non-parametric (`instance based') 
methods such as HAC that use pairwise distances between
examples (vs between examples and prototypes in K-means) 
become less useful in higher dimensions.

%In the case of nonparametric methods like HAC, where distances are measured as a function of the dimensions, distances become less meaningful in higher dimensions. }}
